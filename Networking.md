circuit switching : guranteed bandwidth for a channel across the intermediate links of the dedicated communication path .  Eg: Old Telephone System
packet switching : network resources are not shared . Links are shared . No guranteed bandwidth . Data transmission becomes slow incase of heavy traffic
    virtual circuit : becoz of route establishment there is initial delay . Eg : Telephone System
    datagram : no route establishment beforehand therefore no initial delay and each paket is transmitted as independent entities hence should have source and destination address  . Eg : Postal System
